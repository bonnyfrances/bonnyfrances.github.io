      <h1>Assignment 2</h1>
      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>This assignment has two tasks. Task one asks you to practice writing and running SQL statements that involve
        <abbr title="Create, Read, Update and Delete">CRUD</abbr> interactions. Task two is to practice building a
        database, with types and tables and populating the tables with data.
      </p>

      <h2>When done you will have created...</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A sql file containing six queries as described in Task One.</li>
        <li>A sql file containing all the code to create a PostgreSQL type, three tables and insert statements to populate two of the tables, built during the activities.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Video Demo</h2>
      <p>This video demonstrates and describes what the Task Two video could look like. This is the <a target="_blank" href="https://byui-cse.github.io/cse340-ww-content/transcripts/assignment2.txt">Transcript</a> of the video.</p>

      <h2>Assumptions</h2>
      <p>This assignment assumes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>you successfully completed the lesson activities.</li>
        <li>you created and saved the SQL file of CREATE, ALTER and INSERT statements for the course database.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Tasks</h2>
      <h3>Task One - Write SQL Statements</h3>

      <p>The Introduction to SQL reading activity contains sample SQL statements for Selecting, Inserting, Updating and
        Deleting data from database table(s), you should have carefully reviewed these as part of this week's
        preparations. Based on the reading:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Create a new <span class="language-markup">assignment2.sql</span> file inside the database folder of your project.</li>
        <li>Build and test your SQL statements in pgAdmin or SQLTools using the course database.</li>
        <li>Whenever writing a SELECT, UPDATE or DELETE query for a single record, use the primary key value in the
          "WHERE" clause to avoid changing or selecting the incorrect record.</li>
        <li>When your statements are working correctly, store them into the <span class="language-markup">assignment2.sql</span> file.</b></li>
        <li>Write SQL statements to accomplish the following tasks. Each task should be performed using a single query per task:
          <ol>
            <li>Insert the following new record to the account table <span class="notice">Note: The account_id and account_type fields
                should handle their own values and do not need to be part of this query.</span>:
              <div><code><mark>Tony, Stark, tony@starkent.com, Iam1ronM@n</mark></code></div>
            </li>
            <li>Modify the Tony Stark record to change the account_type to "<mark>Admin</mark>".</li>
            <li>Delete the Tony Stark record from the database.</li>
            <li>Modify the "GM Hummer" record to read "a huge interior" rather than "small interiors" using a single query.
              Explore the <a href="https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-string-functions/postgresql-replace/" title="Opens in a new tab" target="_blank">PostgreSQL Replace function</a> <mark>Do NOT retype the entire description as part of the query.</mark>.
              It needs to be part of an Update query as shown in the code examples of the <a href="https://go.oreilly.com/byu-idaho/library/view/simply-sql/9780980455250/Text/ch01.html" title="Opens in a new tab" target="_blank">SQL Reading</a> - Read Ch. 1, section 3.</li>
            <li>Use an inner join to select the make and model fields from the inventory table and the classification name field from the classification table for inventory items that belong to the "Sport" category. These resources may help you: <a href="https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-tutorial/postgresql-joins/" title="Link opens in a new tab" target="_blank">https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-tutorial/postgresql-joins/</a>. Two
              records should be returned as a result of the query.</li>

            <li>Update all records in the inventory table to add "/vehicles" to the middle of the file path in the
              inv_image and inv_thumbnail columns using a single query. This reference may prove helpful - <a href="https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-string-functions/postgresql-replace/" title="This page opens in a new tab" target="_blank">https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-string-functions/postgresql-replace/</a>. <mark>When done the path for both inv_image and inv_thumbnail should resemble this example: <code>/images/vehicles/a-car-name.jpg</code></mark>
            </li>
            <li>When done with the six queries, copy and paste queries 4 and 6  from the assignment 2 file to the database rebuild file, at the bottom of that file. Make sure these two queries are the last thing to run when the rebuild file is complete. By the end you should have two files - one with the 6 queries from Task 1, and the second with all the queries to rebuild your database, along with copies of the 4th and 6th queries from Task 1.</li>
            <li>Record a video running the 6 queries and upload to YouTube/OneDrive/Google Drive</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Objective 4</h3>
      <ul>
